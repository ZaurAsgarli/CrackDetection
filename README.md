Conglomerate Concrete Crack Detection
This project implements a deep learning-based crack detection system using semantic segmentation to identify cracks in concrete structures from images. It utilizes TensorFlow and image augmentation techniques for improved generalization.

📂 Project Structure
The dataset is assumed to be in a ZIP file and includes training and test images along with their corresponding masks.

🚀 Features
Custom data pipeline using TensorFlow for loading and preprocessing image-mask pairs.

Data augmentation techniques including:

Random horizontal/vertical flips

Random brightness and contrast adjustments

Support for batching and prefetching with tf.data for optimized performance.

🧠 Model Training
Model training (not fully shown here) is expected to be done using U-Net or another semantic segmentation architecture using the prepared train_dataset and val_dataset.

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.7+

TensorFlow 2.x

Google Colab (optional for notebook execution)

matplotlib (for visualization)

Install dependencies using:

pip install tensorflow matplotlib
📊 Visualization
Sample visualizations show side-by-side images and masks to inspect the alignment of predicted and actual regions.

📦 How to Use
